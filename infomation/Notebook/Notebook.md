## Analysis

Researched different python modules to use for game development: [here](https://geekflare.com/python-game-development-libraries-frameworks/)

Best options were:

* Pygame
  * lots of other people using it
  * fast

* Python Arcade
  * Works well with PyInstaller to make executables

## Exploritory work

Created a class for a basic rigid body which has attributes as numpy arrays which work like vectors (the maths vectors). 2 methods which add a force to the object and one to update the attributed of the object.

Here you can see that the object called ball is being drawn to the screen:

It does not move as no forces are acting on it.
